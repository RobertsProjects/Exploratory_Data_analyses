Analysis of Medical no-show-appointments

Conducted an analysis of a medical appointment attendance. 

Data Wrangling:

Imported all the necessary Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for our data analysis and visualization.
Next, loaded the 'no-show-appointments' dataset and showed its first few rows.
Checking the dataset's shape, data types, and confirming there were no missing values was part of our process.
Identifying and dealing with outliers in the 'Age' column was on our to-do list.
For cleaner data, renamed columns, converted data types, and dropped unnecessary columns.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explored the data to address our research questions.
To address the first question about gender and age affecting appointment attendance, created various visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and histograms. These helped us examine the relationships between gender, age, and attendance.
To tackle the second question about medical conditions (Hypertension and Diabetes) affecting attendance, we analyzed the counts of patients with and without these conditions and used visualizations to understand their impact on attendance.

Conclusions:

In our summary, we highlighted the key findings from our analysis.
We discussed the balanced attendance rate between genders, the age distribution of patients who showed up, and the lack of strong correlations between medical conditions and attendance.
